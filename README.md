# contacts-manager

This is a web app that allows you to manage contacts.

Note-worthy tech used: ASP.NET MVC5, Entity Framework, SQL Server, BootStrap

Problems:
* Global - anyone can modify it. There is no per-user storage.
* UI - needs to be updated.
* Deployment - I need to figure out how to properly deploy it.
